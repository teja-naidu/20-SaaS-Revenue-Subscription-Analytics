# SaaS Revenue & Subscription Analytics — Insights

## Day 1 — Dataset exploration and quality

### Data inventory
- Accounts: 500 rows
- Subscriptions: 5,000 rows
- Feature usage: 25,000 rows
- Support tickets: 2,000 rows
- Churn events: 600 rows
- **Total: 33,100 rows**

### Data model
Accounts connect to subscriptions, support tickets, and churn events by `account_id`. Feature usage connects to subscriptions by `subscription_id`.

### Findings awaiting DuckDB validation
After executing `sql/queries.sql`, add actual outputs for Q10–Q30: primary-key uniqueness, orphan references, date coverage, revenue consistency, plan and billing mix, trial/churn flags, missing values, and invalid metrics. Do not label these checks as passed before reviewing query output.

### Analytical precautions
- The sum of historical subscription MRR rows is not current MRR.
- Account churn events can recur; event counts must not be confused with unique accounts.
- Null subscription `end_date` can mean open-ended, and null satisfaction scores may mean no response.
- Multiple subscriptions per account require explicit deduplication rules for account-level metrics.

### Business questions for subsequent days
How much revenue is active at a chosen reporting date? Which plans generate the most revenue? Which customers churn and why? Does feature adoption or support experience correlate with retention?

### Day 1 result updates
Paste DuckDB output here after execution to document confirmed numerical findings and business recommendations.

# Day 2 – SaaS Revenue & Subscription Performance Analytics

## Objective

Analyze SaaS subscription revenue, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), subscription growth, pricing tiers, billing frequency, customer segments, revenue concentration, and subscription lifecycle characteristics.

**Dataset:** RavenStack SaaS Analytics  
**SQL Engine:** DuckDB  
**Queries:** 31–45  
**Reporting Snapshot:** December 31, 2024  
**Subscription Records:** 5,000  
**Customer Accounts:** 500

> **Important Revenue Definition:** Total recorded MRR represents the sum of MRR values across subscription records. It is not equivalent to revenue recognized over the observation period. Snapshot MRR represents the sum of qualifying active, paid subscription records at a reporting date. Because accounts can have overlapping subscriptions, these values require additional validation before being treated as production-ready financial KPIs.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Day 2 analysis identified the following findings:

- Total recorded subscription MRR: **$11,338,747**
- Total recorded subscription ARR: **$136,064,964**
- Active paid subscription records at December 31, 2024: **3,814**
- Distinct active paid accounts: **500**
- December 31 snapshot MRR: **$10,159,608**
- Enterprise recorded MRR: **$8,473,221**
- Enterprise share of recorded MRR: **74.73%**
- Highest subscription-start month: **December 2024**
- Top industry by recorded MRR: **FinTech**
- Top country by recorded MRR: **United States**
- Top 10 accounts' share of recorded MRR: **8.51%**
- Accounts with multiple active subscription records: **496**

The analysis indicates strong representation of Enterprise-tier subscriptions, substantial subscription-start activity during late 2024, and a high degree of overlapping subscription records.

However, revenue metrics must be interpreted carefully because the dataset contains multiple subscriptions per account.

## 2. Detailed SQL Findings

### Query 31 – Total Recorded Subscription Revenue

**Results**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total subscription records | 5,000 |
| Distinct customer accounts | 500 |
| Total recorded MRR | $11,338,747 |
| Total recorded ARR | $136,064,964 |
| Average recorded ARR per subscription | $27,212.99 |

**Key Findings**

- The dataset contains 5,000 subscription records distributed across 500 accounts.
- Recorded MRR totals approximately $11.34 million.
- Recorded ARR totals approximately $136.06 million.
- ARR is consistent with annualizing recorded MRR by multiplying by 12.
- Each customer has an average of 10 subscription records across the dataset.

**Business Interpretation**

The dataset provides sufficient subscription history for studying revenue composition and subscription behavior.

However, summing all subscription records does not establish a valid point-in-time recurring revenue metric.

**Recommendation**

Use date-filtered active subscriptions for reporting-period MRR and ARR calculations.

---

### Query 32 – Active Paid Subscription Snapshot

**Reporting Date:** December 31, 2024

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Active paid subscription records | 3,814 |
| Distinct active paid accounts | 500 |
| Snapshot MRR | $10,159,608 |
| Average MRR per active subscription record | $2,663.77 |
| Summed MRR per distinct active account | $20,319.22 |

**Key Findings**

- 3,814 subscription records satisfy the active, non-trial, non-churned filtering conditions.
- All 500 customer accounts have at least one qualifying subscription.
- Summed snapshot MRR is approximately $10.16 million.
- The average active subscription record contributes approximately $2,664 in MRR.

**Business Interpretation**

The snapshot provides a more relevant recurring revenue measure than summing all historical subscription records.

Nevertheless, multiple qualifying subscriptions can belong to the same account.

**Recommendation**

Validate whether simultaneous subscriptions represent separate products, additional licenses, or overlapping historical records before publishing account-level MRR.

---

### Query 33 – Monthly Subscription Starts and Associated MRR

**Selected Results**

| Month | New Subscription Records | MRR Associated With Starts |
|---|---:|---:|
| January 2023 | 3 | $4,684 |
| December 2023 | 121 | $267,264 |
| March 2024 | 186 | $421,916 |
| June 2024 | 248 | $537,758 |
| September 2024 | 440 | $992,366 |
| October 2024 | 504 | $1,173,608 |
| November 2024 | 612 | $1,549,040 |
| December 2024 | 953 | $2,273,427 |

**Key Findings**

- Subscription-start volume increased substantially over the observation period.
- December 2024 recorded the highest number of subscription starts, with 953 records.
- December's associated recorded MRR was approximately $2.27 million.
- November 2024 recorded 612 subscription starts and approximately $1.55 million in associated MRR.
- The number of subscription starts increased by approximately 55.72% from November to December 2024.

**Business Interpretation**

Late 2024 shows substantial growth in subscription-start activity.

However, subscription starts are not necessarily unique new customer acquisitions because existing customers may create additional subscriptions.

**Recommendation**

Separate new-customer acquisition, additional subscriptions, and plan transitions in future growth reporting.

---

### Query 34 – Monthly Active Paid MRR Trend

**Selected Original Query Results**

| Snapshot Date | Active Subscription Records | Active Accounts | Summed Active MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2023-01-31 | 3 | 2 | $4,684 |
| 2023-06-28 | 97 | 61 | $204,818 |
| 2023-12-28 | 478 | 177 | $1,152,081 |
| 2024-03-28 | 834 | 246 | $2,085,634 |
| 2024-06-28 | 1,361 | 327 | $3,533,870 |
| 2024-09-28 | 2,215 | 410 | $5,667,273 |
| 2024-11-28 | 3,056 | 473 | $8,083,106 |
| 2024-12-28 | 3,720 | 498 | $9,898,684 |

**Key Findings**

- The original query indicates a strong upward trend in qualifying subscription records and summed active MRR.
- The December 28 snapshot reports approximately $9.90 million in summed active MRR.
- The December 31 snapshot from Query 32 reports approximately $10.16 million.
- These two results are not directly comparable because they use different reporting dates.

**Data Quality Limitation**

The original Query 34 used monthly intervals starting on January 31, 2023.

This generated February 28 followed by the 28th of subsequent months rather than consistent calendar month-end dates.

Consequently, the output must not be described as a validated month-end revenue series.

**Recommendation**

Correct the date-generation logic and rerun Query 34 before publishing month-over-month revenue growth percentages.

---

### Query 35 – Recorded Revenue by Subscription Plan Tier

| Plan Tier | Subscription Records | Recorded MRR | Recorded ARR | MRR Share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Enterprise | 1,723 | $8,473,221 | $101,678,652 | 74.73% |
| Pro | 1,675 | $2,105,089 | $25,261,068 | 18.57% |
| Basic | 1,602 | $760,437 | $9,125,244 | 6.71% |

*Percentages are independently rounded.*

**Key Findings**

- Enterprise subscriptions generate the largest recorded MRR contribution.
- Enterprise represents approximately 34.46% of subscription records but 74.73% of recorded MRR.
- Pro contributes 18.57% of recorded MRR.
- Basic contributes approximately 6.71%.
- Average Enterprise subscription MRR is $4,917.71, compared with $1,256.77 for Pro and $474.68 for Basic.

**Business Interpretation**

Enterprise-tier subscriptions contribute disproportionately to recorded subscription value.

**Recommendation**

Prioritize Enterprise retention and account expansion analysis while maintaining an acquisition and conversion strategy for Basic and Pro customers.

---

### Query 36 – Active Paid Revenue by Plan Tier

**December 31, 2024 Snapshot**

| Plan Tier | Active Records | Active Accounts | Active MRR | Active ARR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Enterprise | 1,304 | 461 | $7,546,876 | $90,562,512 |
| Pro | 1,282 | 446 | $1,924,818 | $23,097,816 |
| Basic | 1,228 | 448 | $687,914 | $8,254,968 |

**Key Findings**

- Enterprise contributes approximately $7.55 million in active-record MRR.
- Pro contributes approximately $1.92 million.
- Basic contributes approximately $688,000.
- Enterprise accounts for approximately 74.28% of summed active-record MRR.
- The number of active accounts across tiers cannot be added together to determine unique customers because an account can appear in multiple tiers.

**Business Interpretation**

The Enterprise segment remains the primary contributor to the active paid subscription snapshot.

**Recommendation**

Track active revenue by tier using a validated subscription ownership and account-level revenue model.

---

### Query 37 – Revenue by Billing Frequency

| Billing Frequency | Subscription Records | Share of Records | Average MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Monthly | 2,539 | 50.78% | $2,261.26 |
| Annual | 2,461 | 49.22% | $2,274.44 |

**Key Findings**

- Monthly and annual billing are nearly evenly distributed.
- Monthly subscriptions represent a slight majority of records.
- Average MRR values are similar between the two billing frequencies.

**Business Interpretation**

The dataset supports comparisons of billing preferences and their relationship with retention.

However, MRR should be normalized consistently for annual billing.

**Recommendation**

Compare churn rates, renewal behavior, and customer lifetime value between annual and monthly subscriptions.

---

### Query 38 – Trial vs Paid Subscription Performance

| Subscription Type | Records | Recorded MRR | Churn-Flagged Records |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Paid | 4,222 | $11,338,747 | 408 |
| Trial | 778 | $0 | 78 |

**Key Findings**

- Paid subscriptions represent 84.44% of subscription records.
- Trial subscriptions represent 15.56%.
- Trial subscriptions contribute zero recorded MRR.
- The dataset contains 408 churn-flagged paid records and 78 churn-flagged trial records.

**Business Interpretation**

Trial subscriptions represent a potential conversion opportunity.

However, these results alone cannot establish a trial-to-paid conversion rate.

**Recommendation**

Use subscription histories to identify trial starts, successful conversions, time to conversion, and trial abandonment.

---

### Query 39 – Upgrade and Downgrade Distribution

| Change Category | Subscription Records | Recorded MRR |
|---|---:|---:|
| No Change | 4,276 | $9,656,818 |
| Upgrade | 506 | $1,222,563 |
| Downgrade | 195 | $418,932 |
| Both Upgrade and Downgrade | 23 | $40,434 |

**Key Findings**

- Most subscription records have neither an upgrade nor a downgrade flag.
- Upgrade-only records outnumber downgrade-only records.
- 23 records have both upgrade and downgrade flags.
- Upgrade-only records account for approximately 10.78% of total recorded MRR.

**Business Interpretation**

Upgrade activity suggests opportunities for expansion revenue.

However, the recorded MRR associated with upgraded subscriptions is not the incremental revenue gained from those upgrades.

**Recommendation**

Calculate expansion and contraction MRR from before-and-after subscription values, and investigate records with conflicting lifecycle flags.

---

### Query 40 – Revenue by Auto-Renewal Status

| Auto-Renewal | Subscription Records | Churn-Flagged Records | Churn-Flag Percentage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Enabled | 4,005 | 390 | 9.74% |
| Disabled | 995 | 96 | 9.65% |

**Key Findings**

- Auto-renewal is enabled on 80.10% of subscription records.
- Churn-flag percentages are similar for enabled and disabled subscriptions.
- The observed difference is only 0.09 percentage points.

**Business Interpretation**

These results do not demonstrate that auto-renewal independently reduces churn.

**Recommendation**

Analyze renewal status alongside subscription tenure, plan tier, customer segment, and actual churn dates before drawing conclusions about retention effectiveness.

---

### Query 41 – Revenue by Customer Industry

| Industry | Accounts | Recorded MRR |
|---|---:|---:|
| FinTech | 112 | $2,669,496 |
| DevTools | 113 | $2,403,654 |
| Cybersecurity | 100 | $2,253,318 |
| EdTech | 79 | $2,043,167 |
| HealthTech | 96 | $1,969,112 |

**Key Findings**

- FinTech is the largest industry by recorded MRR.
- DevTools has the highest number of subscription records, at 1,158.
- EdTech has the highest average MRR per subscription record, at $2,602.76.
- All five industries contribute meaningful recorded subscription value.

**Business Interpretation**

Industry-level segmentation can help identify revenue opportunities and customer retention priorities.

**Recommendation**

Develop industry-specific retention, expansion, and customer-success strategies based on active revenue and churn behavior.

---

### Query 42 – Revenue by Customer Country

| Country | Subscription Records | Recorded MRR |
|---|---:|---:|
| US | 2,961 | $6,634,595 |
| UK | 590 | $1,220,471 |
| IN | 498 | $1,194,325 |
| AU | 312 | $839,980 |
| FR | 211 | $589,796 |
| CA | 217 | $477,562 |
| DE | 211 | $382,018 |

**Key Findings**

- The United States contributes approximately 58.51% of total recorded MRR.
- The United Kingdom and India are the next-largest markets by recorded MRR.
- France has the highest average MRR per subscription record at $2,795.24.
- Geographic revenue distribution is concentrated in the United States.

**Business Interpretation**

The US is the primary recorded revenue market, while international markets provide additional opportunities for growth.

**Recommendation**

Compare active MRR, churn, customer acquisition, and expansion performance by country before prioritizing geographic investments.

---

### Query 43 – Top 20 Accounts by Recorded Subscription MRR

**Top Five Accounts**

| Account | Industry | Country | Recorded MRR |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Company_403 | FinTech | US | $138,060 |
| Company_166 | DevTools | US | $133,298 |
| Company_358 | EdTech | FR | $130,152 |
| Company_368 | EdTech | AU | $94,710 |
| Company_337 | Cybersecurity | IN | $87,957 |

**Key Findings**

- Company_403 has the highest aggregate recorded subscription MRR.
- Company_166 and Company_358 are the next-largest accounts.
- Several EdTech accounts appear among the highest-value customers.
- The top accounts span multiple industries and countries.

**Business Interpretation**

High-value accounts are important candidates for customer-success prioritization.

However, the ranking is based on summed recorded subscription values, not verified current account-level MRR.

**Recommendation**

Build a validated current-revenue account ranking before assigning revenue-risk classifications or strategic account priorities.

---

### Query 44 – Revenue Concentration Among Top Accounts

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total accounts | 500 |
| Total recorded MRR | $11,338,747 |
| Top 10 accounts' recorded MRR | $964,589 |
| Top 10 revenue share | 8.51% |
| Top 50 revenue share | 26.88% |

**Key Findings**

- The top 10 accounts represent 8.51% of total recorded MRR.
- The top 50 accounts represent 26.88%.
- Recorded subscription value is distributed across a relatively broad account base.

**Business Interpretation**

The results suggest that recorded MRR is not dominated by a small group of customers.

However, current revenue concentration may differ from historical recorded subscription concentration.

**Recommendation**

Recalculate concentration using verified current account-level MRR and monitor revenue exposure to the largest customers.

---

### Query 45 – Subscription Overlap and Revenue Quality

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Active paid accounts | 500 |
| Accounts with multiple active records | 496 |
| Maximum active records for one account | 16 |
| MRR from multi-record accounts | $10,153,020 |
| Share of summed snapshot MRR from multi-record accounts | 99.94% |

**Key Findings**

- 496 of 500 active paid accounts have multiple qualifying subscription records.
- Some accounts have as many as 16 simultaneous qualifying records.
- Multi-record accounts contribute approximately $10.15 million in summed snapshot MRR.
- Approximately 99.94% of snapshot MRR comes from accounts with multiple active subscription records.

**Critical Data Quality Finding**

The dataset contains substantial subscription overlap.

This does not automatically establish duplicate revenue because customers may legitimately hold multiple products, contracts, or licenses.

However, the current analysis does not determine whether overlapping records represent independent billable subscriptions or duplicated subscription history.

**Recommendation**

Investigate subscription overlap using subscription IDs, contract dates, plan changes, and product-level identifiers.

Do not deduplicate subscriptions solely by account ID because doing so could incorrectly remove legitimate revenue.

---

## 3. Business Recommendations

### Recommendation 1 – Protect Enterprise Revenue

Enterprise subscriptions contribute approximately three-quarters of recorded MRR.

Actions:
- Monitor Enterprise churn and downgrade behavior.
- Prioritize high-value customer retention.
- Identify expansion opportunities among established accounts.
- Evaluate customer-success coverage for high-value contracts.

### Recommendation 2 – Improve Revenue Reporting Accuracy

The dataset contains substantial overlapping subscription activity.

Actions:
- Define a validated active-subscription reporting model.
- Distinguish independent subscriptions from historical replacements.
- Establish consistent MRR and ARR calculation rules.
- Reconcile account-level subscription revenue before financial reporting.

### Recommendation 3 – Investigate Late-2024 Subscription Growth

December 2024 has the highest subscription-start volume.

Actions:
- Separate new customers from existing-customer subscription additions.
- Investigate whether plan transitions create additional records.
- Compare monthly acquisition and expansion activity.
- Validate growth trends using corrected month-end reporting dates.

### Recommendation 4 – Develop Segment-Specific Strategies

FinTech, DevTools, and Cybersecurity contribute substantial recorded MRR.

Actions:
- Compare active revenue and churn by industry.
- Identify industries with higher expansion potential.
- Develop targeted customer-success programs.
- Evaluate international growth opportunities using country-level metrics.

### Recommendation 5 – Strengthen Subscription Lifecycle Analytics

Upgrade, downgrade, trial, and churn flags provide useful lifecycle signals.

Actions:
- Measure actual expansion and contraction MRR.
- Track trial-to-paid conversion.
- Compare annual and monthly retention.
- Investigate conflicting upgrade/downgrade flags.
- Measure churn using event dates and eligible populations.

---

## 4. Data Quality Findings and Limitations

### 4.1 Historical Revenue vs Snapshot Revenue

Summing recorded MRR across all subscription rows does not produce a valid historical revenue total or current MRR figure.

Historical subscription records may represent different time periods.

### 4.2 Multiple Active Subscriptions

496 accounts contain multiple active paid subscription records at the reporting snapshot.

The business meaning of these overlapping records requires validation.

### 4.3 Month-End Date Generation

Query 34 generates the 28th of most months after February 2023 rather than true calendar month-end dates.

The original trend is retained as an exploratory result only.

### 4.4 Churn Flag Interpretation

A churn flag is not necessarily equivalent to a churn event within a specified reporting period.

Historical churn calculations require consistent event-date and population definitions.

### 4.5 Upgrade and Downgrade Revenue

MRR associated with upgrade or downgrade flags does not equal incremental expansion or contraction revenue.

Previous and subsequent subscription values are required.

### 4.6 Billing Frequency Normalization

Annual and monthly billing must be represented consistently in monthly recurring revenue calculations.

### 4.7 Account-Level Revenue Attribution

Summed MRR divided by distinct accounts does not necessarily represent standard SaaS ARPA when subscription overlap is unresolved.

### 4.8 Reporting Snapshot Assumptions

The active snapshot excludes trials and churn-flagged records and uses subscription start and end dates.

This approach assumes the flags are valid for the reporting date. If churn flags represent eventual churn rather than point-in-time churn, historical snapshots may be biased.

---

## 5. Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Day 2 Result |
|---|---:|
| Subscription records | 5,000 |
| Distinct customer accounts | 500 |
| Total recorded MRR | $11,338,747 |
| Total recorded ARR | $136,064,964 |
| December 31 active paid records | 3,814 |
| December 31 summed active MRR | $10,159,608 |
| Enterprise recorded MRR share | 74.73% |
| Monthly billing share | 50.78% |
| Annual billing share | 49.22% |
| Trial subscription records | 778 |
| Upgrade-only records | 506 |
| Downgrade-only records | 195 |
| Auto-renewal enabled records | 4,005 |
| Top 10 account revenue share | 8.51% |
| Top 50 account revenue share | 26.88% |
| Accounts with multiple active records | 496 |

---

## 6. Final Day 2 Conclusion

Day 2 analyzed 5,000 subscription records across 500 customer accounts using 15 SQL queries.

The analysis identified Enterprise as the dominant recorded revenue tier, strong subscription-start activity in late 2024, substantial US market representation, and a relatively distributed recorded revenue base.

The most significant technical finding is the prevalence of multiple active subscription records per customer.

This requires additional validation before using aggregated subscription revenue as a production-ready financial KPI.

The monthly revenue trend also requires corrected calendar month-end snapshots.

Overall, Day 2 establishes a foundation for SaaS revenue segmentation, subscription performance reporting, and future churn and retention analysis.

**Day 2 Status:** 15 queries executed; exploratory insights documented; revenue validation limitations identified.

# Day 3 – Customer Churn & Retention Analytics

## Objective

Analyze SaaS customer churn events, subscription churn indicators, churn reasons, customer segments, subscription tenure, auto-renewal behavior, account-level churn exposure, and churn-related recurring revenue.

**Dataset:** RavenStack SaaS Analytics  
**SQL Engine:** DuckDB  
**Queries:** 46–60  
**Analysis Period:** January 2023 – December 2024  
**Subscription Records:** 5,000  
**Customer Accounts:** 500  
**Churn Events:** 600

### Important Metric Definitions

- **Churn Event:** An individual record in the `churn_events` table.
- **Churn-Flagged Subscription:** A record in `subscriptions` where `churn_flag = TRUE`.
- **Churn-Flag Percentage:** Churn-flagged subscription records divided by total subscription records in the relevant segment.
- **Churn-Flagged MRR:** Sum of recorded MRR associated with churn-flagged subscriptions.
- **Account Churn Exposure:** Whether an account has at least one churn-flagged subscription record or a recorded churn event.

These metrics are descriptive and should not automatically be interpreted as monthly customer churn rates, realized revenue loss, or confirmed customer departures.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Day 3 successfully executed 15 SQL queries to examine subscription churn patterns and customer retention indicators.

### Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Result |
|---|---:|
| Total subscription records | 5,000 |
| Total customer accounts | 500 |
| Churn-flagged subscription records | 486 |
| Non-churn-flagged subscription records | 4,514 |
| Subscription churn-flag percentage | 9.72% |
| Churn-flagged MRR | $1,179,139 |
| Total recorded churn events | 600 |
| Unique churn event IDs | 600 |
| Accounts with recorded churn events | 352 |
| Earliest churn event | January 25, 2023 |
| Latest churn event | December 31, 2024 |
| Highest churn-event month | December 2024 |
| December 2024 churn events | 117 |
| Most common churn reason | Features |
| Accounts with any subscription churn flag | 312 |
| Accounts with both churn flags and events | 227 |

### Executive Findings

1. Approximately 9.72% of subscription records are marked as churned.
2. The churn-event table contains 600 unique events affecting 352 accounts.
3. Recorded churn-event volume increased substantially toward the end of 2024.
4. Feature limitations, support issues, and budget constraints are the most frequently recorded churn reasons.
5. Enterprise subscriptions account for the largest churn-associated MRR.
6. Short-tenure subscription records have higher churn-flag percentages than longer-tenure records.
7. Subscription churn flags and account-level churn events do not fully align.
8. Churn-related revenue exposure requires further validation before being classified as actual lost MRR.

---

## 2. Detailed SQL Findings

### Query 46 – Overall Subscription Churn Overview

**Results**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total subscription records | 5,000 |
| Total accounts | 500 |
| Churn-flagged records | 486 |
| Non-churn-flagged records | 4,514 |
| Churn-flag percentage | 9.72% |
| Churn-flagged MRR | $1,179,139 |

**Key Findings**

- The dataset contains 486 churn-flagged subscription records.
- The remaining 4,514 records are not churn-flagged.
- Churn-flagged subscriptions represent 9.72% of all subscription records.
- Approximately $1.18 million in recorded MRR is associated with churn-flagged subscriptions.
- Churn-flagged MRR represents approximately 10.40% of the $11.34 million total recorded subscription MRR identified in Day 2.

**Business Interpretation**

The dataset contains meaningful churn-related subscription exposure.

However, the 9.72% metric is a record-level proportion across the dataset, not a monthly customer churn rate.

Similarly, churn-flagged MRR is not necessarily revenue lost during a particular reporting period.

**Business Recommendation**

Establish separate definitions for subscription churn, customer churn, gross revenue churn, and net revenue retention.

Use churn dates and period-specific revenue snapshots to calculate operational retention KPIs.

---

### Query 47 – Churn Event Summary

**Results**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total churn events | 600 |
| Unique churn events | 600 |
| Accounts with churn events | 352 |
| Earliest churn date | January 25, 2023 |
| Latest churn date | December 31, 2024 |

**Key Findings**

- All 600 churn event IDs are unique.
- Churn events affect 352 distinct accounts.
- Multiple churn events can belong to the same account.
- Recorded churn activity spans nearly the entire dataset observation period.

**Business Interpretation**

The event table captures churn activity at the account level but does not directly identify the subscription associated with each event.

Consequently, the 352 affected accounts should not be interpreted as 352 customers permanently lost.

**Business Recommendation**

Investigate repeat churn events, customer reactivation, and account subscription status following churn events.

---

### Query 48 – Monthly Churn Event Trend

**Results**

| Month | Churn Events | Affected Accounts |

| November 2024 | 68 | 60 |
| December 2024 | 117 | 96 |

*February 2023 has no row in the original query output because no churn events were recorded for that month.*

**Key Findings**

- Recorded churn-event volume generally increased during the observation period.
- December 2024 had the highest monthly event count, at 117.
- December's churn events affected 96 distinct accounts.
- November 2024 recorded 68 events affecting 60 accounts.
- Event volume increased approximately 72.06% between November and December 2024.
- Multiple events affected some accounts within individual months.

**Business Interpretation**

The rising number of churn events could reflect a growing subscription base, changing customer behavior, or both.

Event counts alone do not establish that the churn rate increased.

**Business Recommendation**

Calculate monthly customer churn rates using a consistent opening active-customer population.

Investigate the December 2024 event increase and compare it with customer acquisition and subscription growth.

### Query 49 – Churn Reasons Distribution

**Results**

| Churn Reason | Events | Affected Accounts | Share of Events |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Features | 114 | 104 | 19.00% |
| Support | 104 | 95 | 17.33% |
| Budget | 104 | 94 | 17.33% |
| Unknown | 95 | 86 | 15.83% |
| Competitor | 92 | 79 | 15.33% |
| Pricing | 91 | 86 | 15.17% |

**Key Findings**

- Feature-related issues are the most frequently recorded churn reason.
- Support issues and budget constraints are tied for second.
- Features and support together account for 218 events, or 36.33% of all churn events.
- Budget and pricing together account for 195 events, or 32.50%.
- Approximately 15.83% of churn events have an unknown reason.

**Business Interpretation**

Product capabilities, customer support, and affordability appear repeatedly in recorded churn reasons.

However, the reason distribution does not establish causality or the relative revenue impact of each reason.

**Business Recommendation**

- Review feature-related churn feedback with Product teams.
- Investigate support-related churn and ticket resolution experiences.
- Analyze budget and pricing objections by plan tier.
- Improve churn-reason collection to reduce unknown classifications.

### Query 50 – Churn by Subscription Plan Tier

**Results**

| Plan Tier | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Enterprise | 1,723 | 172 | 9.98% | $926,345 |
| Pro | 1,675 | 162 | 9.67% | $180,271 |
| Basic | 1,602 | 152 | 9.49% | $72,523 |

**Key Findings**

- Enterprise has the highest churn-flag percentage at 9.98%.
- Basic has the lowest at 9.49%.
- The difference between Enterprise and Basic is 0.49 percentage points.
- Enterprise contributes approximately 78.56% of all churn-flagged MRR.
- Enterprise's churn-associated MRR is significantly higher because its subscription values are larger.

**Business Interpretation**

Enterprise is the largest churn-associated revenue exposure segment.

However, the small differences in churn-flag percentages do not demonstrate a substantial difference in customer retention between tiers.

**Business Recommendation**

Prioritize Enterprise account reviews while measuring actual churn rates and realized revenue losses by plan tier.

---

### Query 51 – Churn by Billing Frequency

**Results**

| Billing Frequency | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Annual | 2,461 | 247 | 10.04% | $549,373 |
| Monthly | 2,539 | 239 | 9.41% | $629,766 |

**Key Findings**

- Annual subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 10.04%.
- Monthly subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 9.41%.
- The observed difference is 0.63 percentage points.
- Monthly subscriptions account for more churn-flagged MRR despite having fewer churn-flagged records.

**Business Interpretation**

The observed data does not support a conclusion that annual billing necessarily produces lower churn.

Differences in subscription tenure, contract expiration, and plan composition may affect the results.

**Business Recommendation**

Compare renewal outcomes and cohort-based churn rates for annual and monthly subscriptions.

---

### Query 52 – Trial vs Paid Subscription Churn

**Results**

| Subscription Type | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Trial | 778 | 78 | 10.03% | $0 |
| Paid | 4,222 | 408 | 9.66% | $1,179,139 |

**Key Findings**

- Trial subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 10.03%.
- Paid subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 9.66%.
- All churn-flagged MRR is associated with paid subscriptions.
- Trial subscriptions have zero recorded MRR.

**Business Interpretation**

Trial abandonment and paid subscription churn are different lifecycle outcomes and should not automatically be combined.

The dataset does not provide a trial-to-paid conversion rate through this query.

**Business Recommendation**

Track trial conversion, trial abandonment, paid churn, and reactivation separately.

---

### Query 53 – Churn by Customer Industry

**Results**

| Industry | Records | Accounts | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| DevTools | 1,158 | 113 | 125 | 10.79% | $238,611 |
| Cybersecurity | 1,008 | 100 | 103 | 10.22% | $279,062 |
| HealthTech | 949 | 96 | 96 | 10.12% | $209,277 |
| FinTech | 1,100 | 112 | 96 | 8.73% | $253,446 |
| EdTech | 785 | 79 | 66 | 8.41% | $198,743 |

**Key Findings**

- DevTools has the highest churn-flag percentage at 10.79%.
- EdTech has the lowest at 8.41%.
- Cybersecurity has the largest churn-flagged MRR at $279,062.
- FinTech follows with $253,446.
- DevTools has the highest number of churn-flagged records, at 125.

**Business Interpretation**

Different industries exhibit different churn-associated subscription patterns.

Industry rankings vary depending on whether churn is measured by record count, percentage, or associated MRR.

**Business Recommendation**

Develop industry-specific retention analysis using actual churn events, revenue exposure, customer tenure, and product usage.

---

### Query 54 – Churn by Customer Country

**Results**

| Country | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FR | 211 | 25 | 11.85% | $100,563 |
| AU | 312 | 35 | 11.22% | $88,549 |
| UK | 590 | 64 | 10.85% | $175,279 |
| US | 2,961 | 288 | 9.73% | $645,721 |
| CA | 217 | 21 | 9.68% | $43,327 |
| DE | 211 | 20 | 9.48% | $44,111 |
| IN | 498 | 33 | 6.63% | $81,589 |

**Key Findings**

- France has the highest churn-flag percentage at 11.85%.
- India has the lowest at 6.63%.
- The United States has the highest churn-flagged MRR at $645,721.
- US subscriptions represent the largest absolute churn-associated revenue exposure.

**Business Interpretation**

The country with the highest churn-flag percentage is not necessarily the country with the greatest revenue exposure.

**Business Recommendation**

Monitor both churn frequency and revenue impact across markets, accounting for differences in customer composition and subscription tenure.

---

### Query 55 – Churn by Auto-Renewal Status

**Results**

| Auto-Renewal | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Enabled | 4,005 | 390 | 9.74% | $968,478 |
| Disabled | 995 | 96 | 9.65% | $210,661 |

**Key Findings**

- Auto-renewal is enabled on 80.10% of subscription records.
- Enabled subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 9.74%.
- Disabled subscriptions have a churn-flag percentage of 9.65%.
- The difference is only 0.09 percentage points.

**Business Interpretation**

The data does not establish a meaningful retention advantage for auto-renewal.

Auto-renewal settings may also change during the subscription lifecycle.

**Business Recommendation**

Study renewal success, failed payments, cancellations, and contract expiration outcomes rather than relying solely on the churn flag.

---

### Query 56 – Subscription Tenure Distribution

**Results**

| Tenure Category | Subscription Records | Accounts | Average Tenure Days |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Less Than 1 Month | 1,038 | 353 | 12.95 |
| 1–3 Months | 1,131 | 403 | 57.17 |
| 3–6 Months | 1,075 | 386 | 131.36 |
| 6–12 Months | 1,146 | 334 | 258.38 |
| 12+ Months | 610 | 188 | 474.11 |

**Key Findings**

- The 6–12 month category contains the most records, at 1,146.
- The 1–3 month category contains 1,131 records.
- Only 610 subscription records fall into the 12+ month category.
- A substantial portion of subscription records have relatively short calculated tenure.

**Business Interpretation**

Subscription tenure is influenced by the observation period and subscription start dates.

The query uses subscription end dates when available and December 31, 2024 otherwise.

**Business Recommendation**

Distinguish completed subscription lifetimes from ongoing, right-censored subscriptions in future retention analysis.

---

### Query 57 – Churn by Subscription Tenure

**Results**

| Tenure Category | Records | Churn-Flagged | Churn-Flag % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Less Than 1 Month | 1,038 | 204 | 19.65% |
| 1–3 Months | 1,131 | 126 | 11.14% |
| 3–6 Months | 1,075 | 77 | 7.16% |
| 6–12 Months | 1,146 | 58 | 5.06% |
| 12+ Months | 610 | 21 | 3.44% |

**Key Findings**

- Subscriptions with calculated tenure below one month have the highest churn-flag percentage.
- The percentage declines across longer tenure categories.
- The 12+ month category has the lowest churn-flag percentage at 3.44%.
- The less-than-one-month category accounts for 204 churn-flagged records.

**Business Interpretation**

The descriptive pattern suggests an association between shorter calculated tenure and churn flags.

However, the query does not establish that longer tenure causes better retention.

Completed and ongoing subscriptions are treated differently, and subscription end dates may be associated with churn itself.

**Business Recommendation**

Conduct cohort-based retention and survival analysis using consistent observation windows.

Investigate early customer onboarding and activation experiences.

---

### Query 58 – Account-Level Churn Exposure

**Results**

| Metric | Accounts |
|---|---:|
| Total accounts | 500 |
| Accounts with any churn flag | 312 |
| Accounts with mixed churn flags | 312 |
| Accounts with all records churn-flagged | 0 |
| Accounts without churn flags | 188 |

**Key Findings**

- 312 accounts have at least one churn-flagged subscription.
- All 312 also have at least one non-churn-flagged subscription.
- No account has every subscription record marked as churned.
- 188 accounts have no churn-flagged subscription records.

**Business Interpretation**

A subscription-level churn flag does not necessarily indicate that the entire customer account has churned.

The presence of both flagged and non-flagged records may reflect multiple subscriptions or subscription history.

**Business Recommendation**

Define customer churn using account-level paid subscription activity and an explicit reporting period.

---

### Query 59 – Account-Level Churn Flag vs Churn Event Reconciliation

**Results**

| Reconciliation Category | Accounts | Subscription Records | Churn-Flagged Records | Churn Events |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Has Churn Flag and Event | 227 | 2,430 | 352 | 386 |
| Has Churn Event Only | 125 | 1,098 | 0 | 214 |
| Has Churn Flag Only | 85 | 905 | 134 | 0 |
| Neither Flag nor Event | 63 | 567 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **500** | **5,000** | **486** | **600** |

**Key Findings**

- 227 accounts have both churn-flagged subscriptions and recorded churn events.
- 125 accounts have churn events but no churn-flagged subscriptions.
- 85 accounts have churn-flagged subscriptions but no recorded churn events.
- 63 accounts have neither indicator.
- The reconciliation preserves all 500 accounts, 5,000 subscription records, 486 churn flags, and 600 churn events.

**Critical Data Quality Finding**

The `churn_events` table does not contain a `subscription_id` field.

Therefore, direct subscription-to-event reconciliation is not possible with the available schema.

The account-level comparison reveals differences between the two churn indicators but does not prove that either source is incorrect.

**Business Recommendation**

Investigate event-generation rules, subscription churn-flag definitions, and account reactivation behavior.

Introduce a reliable subscription-level event relationship if the source system supports it.

### Query 60 – Top 20 Accounts by Churn-Flagged MRR

**Top 10 Results**

| Account | Industry | Churn-Flagged Records | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Company_358 | EdTech | 6 | $60,465 |
| Company_492 | Cybersecurity | 2 | $26,080 |
| Company_4 | HealthTech | 2 | $23,406 |
| Company_403 | FinTech | 1 | $23,283 |
| Company_47 | DevTools | 4 | $21,066 |
| Company_303 | FinTech | 1 | $20,497 |
| Company_376 | Cybersecurity | 2 | $19,502 |
| Company_278 | Cybersecurity | 2 | $19,502 |
| Company_163 | Cybersecurity | 3 | $19,144 |
| Company_91 | HealthTech | 2 | $19,104 |

**Key Findings**

- Company_358 has the highest churn-flagged MRR at $60,465.
- Company_358 also has six churn-flagged subscription records.
- Several Cybersecurity accounts appear among the highest churn-associated revenue accounts.
- Company_403, previously identified as the highest recorded MRR account in Day 2, also appears in the churn-exposure ranking.
- High churn-flagged MRR does not necessarily indicate complete customer churn.

**Business Interpretation**

Account-level churn-associated revenue can help identify candidates for further investigation.

However, these rankings should not be treated as verified lost-revenue rankings.

**Business Recommendation**

Review high-value accounts using current active MRR, churn-event history, subscription changes, product usage, and support activity.

## 4. Data Quality Findings and Analytical Limitations

### 4.1 Churn Flags vs Churn Events

There are 486 churn-flagged subscription records and 600 recorded churn events.

These are different measures from different tables and cannot be compared as equivalent churn populations.

### 4.2 Missing Subscription Identifier in Churn Events

The churn event table does not contain `subscription_id`.

Direct event-to-subscription reconciliation cannot be performed.

### 4.3 Churn-Flag Percentage Is Not a Period Churn Rate

The 9.72% subscription churn-flag percentage is calculated across all subscription records.

It is not a monthly, quarterly, or annual customer churn rate.

### 4.4 Churn-Flagged MRR Is Not Verified Revenue Loss

The $1,179,139 associated with churn-flagged records is not necessarily the MRR lost in a specific reporting period.

Historical subscription overlap and revenue timing must be considered.

### 4.5 Customer-Level Churn Requires Active Status Validation

An account with one churn-flagged subscription may still have other active subscriptions.

Account churn requires a defined paid-customer status at relevant reporting dates.

### 4.6 Subscription Tenure Has Censoring Limitations

The tenure calculation combines subscription end dates and a reporting-date fallback.

Ongoing subscriptions have incomplete observed lifetimes.

### 4.7 Churn Event Counts Require Population Context

Higher churn-event counts may reflect growth in the number of customers or subscriptions.

Monthly churn rates require a consistent eligible population.

### 4.8 Auto-Renewal Results Are Descriptive

The observed churn-flag percentages for enabled and disabled auto-renewal are similar.

No causal relationship can be established from these results.

### 4.9 Reactivation Is Not Yet Incorporated

Although churn events contain a reactivation indicator, the Day 3 queries do not separately analyze reactivation outcomes.

Reactivation analysis is required for a more complete customer lifecycle view.

### 4.10 Revenue Retention Metrics Are Not Yet Validated

Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) require beginning-period recurring revenue, churn, contraction, and expansion values.

These cannot be established from the current Day 3 churn-flag summaries alone.

## 6. Final Day 3 Conclusion

Day 3 successfully analyzed customer churn and subscription retention indicators using 15 SQL queries across the RavenStack SaaS dataset.

The analysis identified several important patterns:

1. Churn-flagged subscription records represent 9.72% of the dataset.
2. Recorded churn-event volume increased toward the end of 2024.
3. Feature limitations, support issues, and budget constraints are leading recorded churn reasons.
4. Enterprise subscriptions contribute the largest churn-associated recurring revenue.
5. Shorter calculated subscription tenure is associated with higher churn-flag percentages.
6. Churn flags and churn events differ substantially at the account level.
7. Subscription overlap and incomplete event relationships limit the ability to calculate validated customer and revenue churn metrics.

The findings provide a foundation for improving customer onboarding, product experience, Enterprise retention, churn data quality, and revenue-risk reporting.

Future analysis should extend these results through customer cohort retention, reactivation, revenue movement, and product usage analysis.

**Day 3 Status:** Completed – Queries 46–60 executed and documented.

## 2. Detailed SQL Findings

### Query 61 – Feature Usage Data Profiling

**Results**

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Total usage records | 25,000 |
| Unique usage IDs | 24,979 |
| Subscriptions with usage | 4,967 |
| Distinct features | 40 |
| Total feature uses | 250,525 |
| Total usage hours | 21,126.41 |
| Total errors | 14,107 |
| Beta usage records | 2,544 |

**Key Findings**

- Feature usage is recorded for 4,967 of the 5,000 subscriptions.
- Subscription usage coverage is approximately 99.34%.
- There are 40 distinct features in the dataset.
- The dataset contains 25,000 feature usage records.
- Only 24,979 distinct usage IDs are present, resulting in 21 duplicate ID occurrences.
- Total recorded feature usage exceeds 250,000 actions.
- Beta feature records account for approximately 10.18% of all usage records.

**Business Interpretation**

The dataset provides broad coverage of subscription-level product activity.

However, recorded usage does not necessarily mean that every subscription
is actively engaged during a specific reporting period.

Duplicate usage identifiers also require validation before using
the records for financial or operational reporting.

**Business Recommendations**

- Investigate duplicate usage IDs.
- Monitor feature adoption by subscription and customer.
- Establish consistent definitions for active usage.
- Track product errors and beta feature adoption separately.
- Introduce monthly engagement monitoring.

| feature_26 | 649 | 616 | 548.99 | 64.45 |

The table shows the first ten features from the SQL ranking by
total recorded feature uses.

**Key Findings**

- Feature usage is distributed across 40 features.
- feature_32 appears first in the total-uses ranking.
- feature_12 has 624 distinct subscriptions with recorded usage.
- feature_26 has 417 recorded errors and 64.45 errors per 1,000 uses.
- Some features show higher normalized error frequency despite similar usage volumes.

**Business Interpretation**

High usage volume indicates product activity but does not necessarily
demonstrate customer satisfaction or business value.

Feature-level error frequency may help identify areas requiring
engineering investigation.

**Business Recommendations**

- Monitor feature popularity and adoption.
- Review features with higher normalized error frequency.
- Compare adoption against eligible subscriptions.
- Prioritize reliability improvements using usage and error metrics.
- Investigate whether frequently used features contribute to retention.

- October also has the highest number of distinct subscriptions with usage.
- November records lower usage than October.
- December usage increases compared with November.
- Product errors vary by month and do not always move proportionally with usage volume.

**Business Interpretation**

The monthly results provide a foundation for product engagement monitoring.

However, monthly active subscriptions are not equivalent to monthly
active customer accounts or unique active users.

**Business Recommendations**

- Track monthly active subscriptions and accounts separately.
- Monitor changes in engagement across subscription cohorts.
- Compare feature usage with customer acquisition and churn.
- Investigate unusual changes in monthly usage.
- Normalize error counts by usage volume.

| Basic | 7,980 | 1,602 | 79,888 | 6,691.56 | 4,435 |

**Key Findings**

- Enterprise subscriptions generate the highest total feature usage.
- Pro follows closely behind Enterprise.
- Basic generates 79,888 recorded feature uses.
- All three plan tiers contribute substantial product activity.
- Differences in total usage partly reflect differences in subscription counts.

**Business Interpretation**

Enterprise customers generate the largest aggregate feature usage,
but this does not establish that individual Enterprise subscriptions
are more engaged.

Usage intensity should be normalized by subscription count,
active days, and other relevant factors.

**Business Recommendations**

- Compare average feature usage per subscription.
- Monitor plan-specific feature adoption.
- Identify features that encourage upgrades.
- Investigate underutilized premium features.
- Develop engagement benchmarks for each plan tier.

| Moderate Usage | 249 | 642.28 | 31.72 |

**Key Findings**

- One account falls into the Very Low Usage category.
- Exactly 250 accounts fall into the Low Usage category.
- Another 249 accounts fall into Moderate Usage.
- No accounts fall into No Recorded Usage or High Usage under the selected thresholds.
- Moderate-engagement accounts use more distinct features on average.

**Business Interpretation**

The selected thresholds divide most accounts between low and
moderate engagement.

These categories are exploratory and have not been validated against
business outcomes.

**Business Recommendations**

- Calibrate engagement thresholds using the actual usage distribution.

---

### Query 67 – Feature Engagement vs Subscription Churn Flags

**Results**

| Engagement Segment | Subscriptions | Churn-Flagged | Average Distinct Features | Churn-Flagged MRR |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| No Usage | 33 | 3 | 0.00 | $3,973 |
| Very Low | 4,838 | 473 | 4.61 | $1,148,557 |
| Low | 129 | 10 | 9.10 | $26,609 |

**Calculated Churn-Flag Percentages**

- No Usage: 9.09%
- Very Low: 9.78%
- Low: 7.75%

**Key Findings**

- Most subscription records fall into the Very Low engagement segment.
- The Very Low segment contains 473 churn-flagged records.
- The No Usage segment contains 33 subscriptions.
- The Low segment has a lower churn-flag percentage than Very Low.
- No subscriptions reach the Moderate or High usage thresholds.

**Business Interpretation**

The subscription-level engagement thresholds are poorly distributed
for this dataset.

A concentration of subscriptions in one segment limits the usefulness
of the segmentation.

These results do not establish a causal relationship between
feature engagement and churn.

**Business Recommendations**

- Redefine subscription-level engagement thresholds.
- Consider usage percentiles rather than fixed thresholds.
- Normalize usage by subscription lifetime.
- Compare engagement before churn events.
- Evaluate engagement and churn within comparable cohorts.

- This represents 34.85% of all support tickets.
- Another 626 tickets require between 24 and 48 hours.
- A total of 1,323 tickets, or 66.15%, require at least 24 hours.
- Only 93 tickets are resolved in under four hours.
- The 48+ hour category contains the largest number of escalated tickets.

**Business Interpretation**

Longer resolution durations represent a potential customer
experience concern.

However, service-level compliance cannot be determined without
defined targets and applicable ticket conditions.

**Business Recommendations**

- Review tickets with resolution times of 48 hours or longer.
- Identify operational bottlenecks.
- Analyze escalated tickets with long resolution times.
- Establish resolution performance targets.
- Monitor the relationship between resolution duration and satisfaction.

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| High Attention | 1 | 92.00 | 6.00 | 1 |
| Elevated Attention | 252 | 364.41 | 4.02 | 42 |
| Moderate Attention | 247 | 642.11 | 3.97 | 52 |

**Key Findings**

- One account is classified as High Attention.
- 252 accounts are classified as Elevated Attention.
- 247 accounts are classified as Moderate Attention.
- No accounts fall into Standard Monitoring.
- Elevated Attention accounts have lower average feature usage than Moderate Attention accounts.
- The Moderate Attention segment has more total escalations than the Elevated Attention segment.

**Business Interpretation**

The segmentation combines feature engagement and support activity
to identify accounts requiring further review.

However, the fixed thresholds are exploratory and do not represent
validated probabilities of customer churn.

The absence of Standard Monitoring accounts indicates that
the segmentation should be recalibrated.

---

## 4. Data Quality Findings and Analytical Limitations

### 4.1 Duplicate Feature Usage Identifiers

The feature usage table contains 25,000 records but only
24,979 unique usage IDs.

Duplicate IDs require investigation before deduplication rules
can be established.

### 4.2 Engagement Does Not Equal Customer Retention

High product usage does not automatically imply customer retention.

Retention analysis requires time-based customer lifecycle information.

### 4.3 Subscription-Level and Account-Level Metrics Differ

Feature usage is linked to subscriptions.

Support tickets are linked to accounts.

Joining these tables without appropriate aggregation can
duplicate support records and distort results.

### 4.4 Usage Thresholds Are Exploratory

The engagement categories use fixed thresholds that are not
calibrated to the dataset distribution.

They should not be treated as validated customer health scores.

### 4.5 Missing Satisfaction Ratings

825 tickets have missing satisfaction scores.

Reported averages apply only to rated tickets and may not
represent the full support population.

### 4.6 Support Ticket Closure vs Resolution Quality

All tickets contain closure timestamps.

This does not independently confirm satisfactory resolution.

### 4.7 No Support Category Field

The support ticket dataset does not include a ticket category
or issue-type field.

Therefore, category-level support analysis is unavailable.

### 4.8 No Validated SLA Targets

The dataset contains response and resolution durations but
does not define contractual service-level targets.

SLA compliance cannot be calculated reliably.

### 4.9 Account Churn Indicators Differ From Subscription Churn

Queries 74–75 use `accounts.churn_flag`.

Day 3 primarily examined `subscriptions.churn_flag`
and records in `churn_events`.

These indicators should not be assumed to represent
identical customer churn outcomes.

### 4.10 Usage Activity May Not Reflect Valid Subscription Periods

The queries aggregate recorded feature usage without validating
every usage date against subscription start and end dates.

Future analysis should validate subscription lifecycle boundaries.

### 4.11 Feature Error Counts Need Consistent Definitions

The dataset contains `error_count` and `usage_count`.

Errors per 1,000 uses are useful descriptive measures,
but their interpretation depends on how the source system
defines errors and feature uses.

### 4.12 Customer Risk Segmentation Is Not Predictive

The attention segments are rule-based classifications.

They have not been trained or validated against future churn
outcomes and should not be presented as predictive scores.

## 6. Final Day 4 Conclusion

Day 4 successfully analyzed customer engagement, feature adoption,
support ticket performance, customer satisfaction, and exploratory
customer health indicators using 15 DuckDB SQL queries.

The analysis identified several important findings:

1. Feature usage is recorded for nearly all subscriptions.
2. Product activity is distributed across 40 features.
3. Enterprise subscriptions generate the highest aggregate usage.
4. Engagement thresholds require calibration to produce useful segments.
5. Product errors provide an opportunity for reliability analysis.
6. Long support resolution times deserve operational investigation.
7. Customer satisfaction reporting is limited by missing ratings.
8. Support ticket volume alone does not establish customer churn risk.
9. Combined engagement and support metrics can support a more
   comprehensive customer health framework.
10. Data quality and consistent metric definitions remain important
    prerequisites for reliable operational reporting.

The findings provide a foundation for improving product adoption,
customer experience, support operations, and customer retention analysis.

Future analysis should incorporate account lifecycle information,
subscription revenue movements, reactivation behavior, and validated
customer health metrics.

**Day 4 Status:** Completed – Queries 61–75 executed and documented.
